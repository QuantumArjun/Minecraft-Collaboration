  goal: Build a dirt pyramid.
  guidance: '1. Decide on the size of your pyramid. It can be as small or as large as you like.

    2. Find a suitable location for your pyramid. It should be in an open area so that you have plenty of space to work.

    3. Start by digging a hole in the ground. This will be the foundation of your pyramid.

    4. Build up the sides of the hole with blocks of dirt. Make sure that the blocks are evenly spaced and that they are all the same height.

    5. Once you have reached the desired height, start filling in the top of the pyramid with blocks of dirt. Again, make sure that the blocks are evenly spaced and that they are all the same height.'
