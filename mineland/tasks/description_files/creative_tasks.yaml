make_an_arcade_claw_machine:
  goal: 'Make an arcade claw machine '
  guidance: '1. Find a suitable location for your claw machine. An ideal spot would be near a busy area in your Minecraft world where players are constantly coming and going.

    2. Once you''ve found a suitable location, start by building a basic frame for your claw machine. This can be made out of any type of block, but we recommend using blocks that are easy to break down and replace if needed (such as wood or stone).

    3. Next, add a roof to your frame and make sure it''s tall enough to allow the claw to reach the top.

    4. Now it''s time to add the claw itself. This can be made out of any type of block, but we recommend using a block that can easily be broken down and replaced if needed (such as obsidian).

    5. Once the claw is in place, add a sign to the front of the machine that says ''Claw Machine'' or something similar.

    6. Finally, add a chest to the back of the machine and fill it with items that you want players to be able to win (such as diamonds, emeralds, or other rare items).'

    3. on one side of the moat, build a bridge. Make sure the bridge is at least 3 blocks wide and 6 blocks long.

    4. on the other side of the moat, build a drawbridge. The drawbridge should be at least 2 blocks wide and 4 blocks long.

  guidance: '1. Find a good spot to build your pyramid. It should be close to a desert biome for authenticity, but any open area with few trees will do.

    2. Start by building the base of the pyramid. This should be a square platform of stone blocks, at least 50 blocks on each side.

    3. Next, build the four main walls of the pyramid. These should be made of stone blocks as well, and each should be at least 30 blocks tall.

    4. Once the main walls are in place, it''s time to add the pyramid''s iconic stepped layers. Start at the bottom and work your way up, adding one layer of blocks on top of the last.

    5. When you reach the top of the pyramid, add a final layer of blocks to create the pyramid''s point.
